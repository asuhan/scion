// RenderMultiColumnSet represents a set of columns that all have the same width and height. By combining runs of same-size columns into a single
// object, we significantly reduce the number of unique RenderObjects required to represent columns.
//
// A simple multi-column block will have exactly one RenderMultiColumnSet child. A simple paginated multi-column block will have three
// RenderMultiColumnSet children: one for the content at the bottom of the first page (whose columns will have a shorter height), one
// for the 2nd to n-1 pages, and then one last column set that will hold the shorter columns on the final page (that may have to be balanced
// as well).
//
// Column spans result in the creation of new column sets as well, since a spanning fragment has to be placed in between the column sets that
// come before and after the span.
